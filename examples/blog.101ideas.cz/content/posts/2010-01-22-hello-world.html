<p>After a long time I decided to blog again. Let me shortly introduce myself:</p>
<p>I'm a Ruby developer currently living in <b>London</b> and I'm a <b>senior developer</b> at awesome company <a href="http://www.headshift.com/about/index.php">Headshift</a>. My nickname is <a href="http://twitter.com/botanicus">@botanicus</a> and I'm interested in <b>Ruby</b>, <b>Django</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Erlang</b>, <b>Riak</b> &amp; similar stuff.</p>
<p>I was working with great <b>Merb</b> framework for few years till Engine Yard fucked it up and decided to develop shitty Rails.</p>
<p>I have more than few projects at <a href="http://github.com/botanicus/">GitHub</a>, the most important are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/botanicus/rango">Rango</a> is my light-weight web framework with template inheritance and much more interesting features. Currently I'm working on version 0.3 which will introduce apps/plugins distributions as gems, which will basically mean that all the apps will be reusable as plugins in other apps.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/botanicus/pupu">Pupu</a> is a package manager for stuff living in <code>public/</code> like icon sets, JS/CSS framework include plugins like various lightbox implementations, table sorting etc. It can find &amp; download plugins from GitHub and install them, include their dependencies. It also provides helpers for including these plugins with dependencies to your templates etc.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/botanicus/nake">Nake</a> is my Rake replacement with advanced CLI parsing, configuration for tasks and much more.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/botanicus/git-deployer">Git-Deployer</a> is my simple deployment solution based on Git <code>post-receive</code> hook include deployment to multiple servers. It's framework independent, you can use it for Django, Rango, Rails, whatever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, enough about me. Regarding the topics I'm going to write about, don't expect any PR bollocks like “oh cool, the new jQuery is so awesome” (it's not BTW). I want to cover topics like “why your favourite framework is a crap”, write more about patterns and approaches in IT etc.</p>
