<p id="excerpt">
  WebSockets can make web development more enjoyable, <strong>decoupling easier</strong> and the code <strong>easier to understand</strong>. Unfortunately browsers not supporting WebSockets can't be easily ignored yet. SockJS is trying to solve this issue by providing <strong>fallback transports</strong> for browsers not supporting WebSockets.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://sockjs.org">SockJS</a> is a <strong>cross domain solution</strong> and it's designed to <strong>work through restrictive corporate proxies</strong>. SockJS <strong>connection is established swiftly</strong>, unless there's a misbehaving proxy in the middle. This is one of the reasons why <strong>SockJS doesn't use Flash fallback</strong>, which often needs 3 seconds in order to detect problems.
</p>

<h2>How to Use It?</h2>

<p>
  On the client side you just have <code>SockJS</code> object which you use exactly as you'd use the <code>WebSocket</code> class:
</p>

<pre lang="javascript">
&lt;script src=&quot;http://cdn.sockjs.org/sockjs-0.2.1.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  var sock = new SockJS(&quot;http://mydomain.com/my_prefix&quot;);

  // Events: onopen, onmessage, onclose.
  sock.onmessage = function(e) {
    console.log(&quot;message&quot;, e.data);
  };
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  And on the server side you simply use <code>SockJS</code> as a Rack middleware:
</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
# Run one SockJS app on /echo.
use SockJS, &quot;/echo&quot; do |connection|
  connection.subscribe do |session, message|
    session.send(message)
  end
end

# Your main app, anything else than /echo/*.
run MyMainApp.new
</pre>

<p>
  For more in-depth example see sockjs-ruby <a href="https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-ruby">README</a>.
</p>

<p>
  At the moment <strong>only Thin is supported</strong>. That's because Rack itself is inherently synchronous and there's no standard API or convention for handling asynchronous stuff. <strong>Ruby 1.9.2 or higher</strong> is required. For details about dependencies and installation, check <a href="http://TODO">SockJS Ruby release announcement</a> on the RabbitMQ blog.
</p>


<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>
  SockJS isn't the first of its kind. <a href="http://socket.io">Socket.io</a> has been around for quite a while as you probably noticed. However there are some significant differences: firstly Socket.io is a Node.js framework, <strong>Ruby isn't supported</strong><sup><a href="#footnote-1">1)</a></sup>. Secondly Socket.io defines  its own semantic, whereas SockJS is <strong>merely a fallback mechanism for WebSockets</strong> using <strong>WebSockets API</strong>. More about the motivation for writing SockJS as well as more detailed comparison with Socket.io can be found in article <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/08/22/sockjs-web-messaging-aint-easy/">SockJS: Web Messaging Ain't Easy</a>.
</p>


<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>
<p>
  SockJS is intended to work for <strong>all modern browsers</strong>. In the schema below you can see which transport would be used for which browser:

<p>
  Used transports as well as dealing with load balancing and proxies is thoroughly explained in article <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2011/09/13/sockjs-websocket-emulation">SockJS: WebSocket Emulation</a> and on <a href="http://sockjs.org">SockJS main page</a>.
</p>

<h2>So ...</h2>
<p>
  What are you waiting for? SockJS-ruby can be installed from RubyGems as usual:

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <ol><a name="footnote-1">1)</a> There is a <a href="https://github.com/Oblong/Socket.io-Ruby">port of Socket.io for Ruby</a>, but Socket.io isn't really agnostic, whereas SockJS defines a simple protocol and is therefore truly language independent.</ol>
</ul>
