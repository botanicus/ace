<p id="excerpt">
  One of the most important mantras of my life is belief in <strong>no limits</strong>. Anyone can do anything. Most of the limitations exist only in your head!
</p>

<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>
  My background certainly wasn't very motivating. A lot of mediocre, avarage, non-interesting people, weird relationship with my family, absolute disagreement with the way of thinking of the Czech people ... it was pretty bad really.
  Fortunately. It made me so sick of it that I just knew that I can never ever end up like this. It motivated me to aim for the very best.
</p>

Everyone kept telling me I have to obey, I have to go to uni, I have to listen teachers etc. I told them

"We know better, 'cause we're older" -- yeah, right, you already managed to screw up your life, you've got bare arse and now you smartarse think that you can tell me what to do.

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
  Let's start with the education, I just kept hearing "you gotta go to the uni", "you need the bloody diploma" and shite. Well, guess what, I didn't finished even my high school and no one really gives a fuck. That's right mate, you <em>might</em> need it, but it's pretty likely that you don't really need it.

<h2>Country</h2>

<h2>Sell Yourself</h2>
<p>
  "I'm emm, I do, I can do some development" â€“ Wrong! You gotta be confident, tell them that you're pretty damn good and they should be fucking happy to hire you.
  When I came to London, I had 40k vs. Pavel

<h2>People</h2>
<p>
  I used to be pretty shy, but I realised it's not really good for me. I had problems with talking to girls, making friends, talking in front of more people ... so I decided I'll be better of as an extrovert. I went out of my comfort zone and changed. Now I have quite some friends from all over the world, I have no problems with girls whatsoever and <a href="/posts/how-i-learnt-to-talk-in-front-of-people.html">I can talk in front of people</a>.
</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>
  At the beginning I've done some web development. When I've been
  I've been very happy that I can actually do something with Ruby
</p>

<p>
  I have to say I'm really excited about my work: All the people in the office are so incredibly clever, amazing. I'm by no means as clever in terms of IQ as they are, but still I think I'm doing really amazing work.
  I'm 22 now. The next youngest guy from the RabbitMQ team is 27 years old.

<h2>Travelling</h2>
<p>
  One morning I wore up and thought "Oh my God, I'm already two years on one place, it's getting to be boring, let's do some travelling!". So I canceled my tenancy agreement, asked in work if it's OK if I'll be working from Barcelona for some months and that was it.
</p>

<p>
  I have to say I'm having absolutely amazing time! I stay at hostels where I meet a lot of interesting people, I already made so many friends here! Not mention about all the beautiful girls here, oh God!
</p>

  <em>So don't stick to good enough. Go for the best. You'll pay the price by your sweat, but it's just bloody worthy!</em>
