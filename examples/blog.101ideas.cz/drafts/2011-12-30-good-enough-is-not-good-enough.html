The Secret
Enjoy the moment, overcome your fear
Your life is about you, not about how much money can you make. LIVE!
Aim, but enjoy the journey
screw perfectionism
Today society is crazy: work hours, getting drunk, all the professional bollocks
Don't be scared of unknown: it shall be resolved somehow, you
Me personally, I'm scared of the known: you go to a work, you know you'll get a coffee from a bloke called John, you get home, you know your GF will prepare you a supper ... drives me crazy.
The goal is constantly changing
Living in the moment: that's why I want to get a stable income without work
I don’t do boring exercise. If I hate doing something, I stop doing it. I don’t have enough life left to waste doing stuff I hate.
